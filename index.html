                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p id="paragraph">Reinhard Bonnke was born on 19 April 1940, in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany.</p>
                <p>
                Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke was principally known for his Great Gospel Crusades throughout Africa. The son of a pastor, Reinhard surrendered
                his life to Christ at age nine, and heard the call to the African mission field before he was a teenager. He attended Bible College in Wales 
                and was ordained in Germany where he and his wife, Anni, pastored a small church until 1967 when, in obedience to his childhood call, they 
                embarked on missionary life in Africa in the small mountain kingdom of Lesotho. When, in 1974, the Holy Spirit spoke to Reinhard in a 
                recurring dream about “a blood-washed Africa,” he founded Christ for All Nations, 
                becoming the inspiring visionary who always spoke of “plundering hell to populate heaven,” a dedicated preacher who saw “signs following” 
                as the necessary evidence of the power of the Gospel to save, heal, and deliver.

                <h2>Ministry</h2>
                <p id="paragraph">Early on, Bonnke encountered poor results from his evangelistic efforts and felt frustrated at the pace of his ministry. 
                 Bonnke claims to have had a recurring dream featuring a picture of the map of Africa being
                 spread with red and heard the voice of God crying "Africa Shall Be Saved". This led him to adopt large-scale evangelism, 
                 rather than the traditional small scale missionary approach. He rented a stadium in Gaborone, Botswana and preached with 
                 little cooperation from local churches. Beginning with only 100 people, the stadium meetings grew.
                In 1974, Bonnke founded the mission organisation Christ For All Nations (abbreviated CfaN). Originally based in 
                Johannesburg, South Africa, the headquarters were relocated to Frankfurt, Germany, in 1986. This was done primarily 
                to distance the organisation from South Africa's apartheid policy at the time. Today CfaN has 9 offices across 5 continents</p>

                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">Bonnke died on 7 December 2019, surrounded by his family according to a statement signed by his wife.
                 Bonnke had announced on his official Facebook page in November 2019 that he had undergone femur surgery 
                 and needed time to "learn how to walk again".</p>

                <h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
                <p id="paragraph">Reinhard Bonnke’s passion for the Gospel endured until the day he died. He preached it “in season and out of season,” 
                wherever in the world the door opened to him, but Africa always remained his primary call. 
                He loved to thunder “Africa shall be saved!” and these words still echo wherever the name of Reinhard Bonnke is known.</p>
